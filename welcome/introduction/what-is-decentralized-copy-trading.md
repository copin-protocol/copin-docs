# What is decentralized copy trading?

## What is decentralized copy trading?

Decentralized copy trading is a method where investors replicate the trades of successful on-chain traders. This allows inexperienced or busy traders to benefit from the expertise and strategies of established traders, potentially improving their investment performance.

Here's how it works:

1. **Trader Selection:** Investors choose experienced traders or strategies they want to follow.
2. **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts on a blockchain automatically replicate the selected trader's trades in the follower's account.
3. **Transparency:** All trading activities, including entry and exit points, are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency.
4. **Security:** Since funds remain in the follower's control, there's a reduced risk of fraud or mismanagement by intermediaries.
5. **Decentralization:** No central authority manages the copy trading platform, reducing the risk of censorship or downtime.

Overall, decentralized copy trading aims to democratize trading by giving users access to proven trading strategies while maintaining control of their funds and data.

## Some benefits of copying on-chain traders.

* **Overcoming FOMO:** Copy trading helps combat impulsive and irrational trading decisions driven by the fear of missing out. By mimicking the moves of seasoned traders, you can tap into their disciplined approach and avoid hasty decisions.
* **Time-saving:** Copy trading reduces the need for extensive market monitoring, analysis, and manual trade execution. By copying skilled traders, you can trade more passively and save time on research and execution.
* **Flexibility:** Copy trading platforms offer customization options for trade size, risk management, and asset allocation. This flexibility allows you to tailor the experience to your needs, goals, and risk appetite while benefiting from the expertise of others.
* **Transparency:** Copy trading provides access to detailed information about the historical performance, risk levels, and portfolio composition of the traders being followed. This transparency enables informed decision-making based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives.
