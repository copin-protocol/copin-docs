Perpetual contracts are a form of derivative contracts that simulate the price movement of an underlying asset without an expiration date. They allow traders to speculate on the price of assets like cryptocurrencies, commodities, or indices without owning the actual asset.These DEXs are decentralized, non-custodial, and permission-less. They use liquidity pools for liquidity, can incorporate order book models, and allow for leveraged perpetual contract trading.</td></tr><tr><td>Trader Account/ Blockchain Address</td><td>A blockchain address, also known as a cryptocurrency address, is a unique identifier used to send, receive, trade, and store digital assets on a blockchain network. It is a string of characters that serves as a destination for cryptocurrency transactions and is used to verify ownership of a particular digital wallet. Blockchain addresses play a crucial role in the security and transparency of cryptocurrency transactions, making them an essential component of the blockchain ecosystem.</td></tr><tr><td>Blockchain Transaction</td><td>A transaction refers to a contract, agreement, transfer, or exchange of assets between two or more parties. The asset is typically cash or property. Likewise, a blockchain transaction is nothing but data transmission across the network of computers in a blockchain system</td></tr></tbody></table>
