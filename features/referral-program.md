# Referral Program

{% hint style="info" %}
Referral program v1.0 - _Updated: 26 Sep, 2023_
{% endhint %}

## **Introduction**

* The Referral feature is highly anticipated by the Copin community. It stands as Copin's catalyst for expansion, fostering the development of a robust community and promoting collaborative support among users. Copin maintains a user-centric approach in feature development, consistently seeking feedback for ongoing enhancement.
* Join as a Copin ambassador, cultivate your Copin network, and progress alongside us. As Copin positions itself as a trailblazer in decentralized copy-trading within the web3 sphere, your current efforts will yield future dividends.
* Simple setup, detailed management, transparent data, and competitive rewards are the principles that Copin will research and build for the Referral feature.

## **Tutorials**

* Step 1: Register and login with a [Copin](https://app.copin.io) account.
* Step 2: Go to `https://app.copin.io/me?tab=referral` or click Referral from menu on top-left
* Step 3: Your referral dashboard, when you can find your referral code and manage your referral list

## **Rules**

* Each user has a unique invitation code which can not be changed at this time
* Users can not update or change who invited them
* Currently, Copin does not collect user fees, so there is no reward mechanism.
