# Referral Program

{% hint style="info" %}
Referral program v1.0 - _Updated: 26 Sep, 2023_
{% endhint %}

### **Introduction**

* The Referral feature is highly anticipated by the Copin community. It stands as Copin's catalyst for expansion, fostering the development of a robust community and promoting collaborative support among users. Copin maintains a user-centric approach in feature development, consistently seeking feedback for ongoing enhancement.
* Join as a Copin ambassador, cultivate your Copin network, and progress alongside us. As Copin positions itself as a trailblazer in decentralized copy-trading within the web3 sphere, your current efforts will yield future dividends.
* Simple setup, detailed management, transparent data, and competitive rewards are the principles that Copin will research and build for the Referral feature.

### **Rules**

* Each user has a unique invitation code which can not be changed at this time.
* Users can not update or change who invited them.
* Currently, Copin does not collect user fees, so there is no reward mechanism.&#x20;
