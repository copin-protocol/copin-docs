## **Introduction**

The Copin Referral Program offers you the opportunity to earn rewards by inviting friends to join Copin and engage in decentralized copy-trading (DCP). Through this program, you and your referrals (F1 and F2) can benefit from fee rebates and commissions. As your referrals actively trade, your earnings will grow based on their activities.

## **How Copin Referral Works**

Copin's referral system operates on multi levels: F0 (You), F1 (Your direct referrals), and F2 (Your referrals' referrals). As an F0, you earn rewards in two ways:

* **Fee Rebate**: A percentage of the fees you pay when trading is returned to you.
* **Commission**: You earn a percentage of the fees paid by your F1 and F2 referrals.

Rewards are tracked once a trading position is closed and are available for claiming at 00:00 UTC the next day. Referral tiers are determined by the total fees paid by F0, F1, and F2 over a 30-day period, with increasing rewards based on the following structure:

| Tiers | Total Fee Paid by F0+F1+F2 (Last 30 Days)	 | F0 (Rebate) | F1 (Commission) | F2 (Commission) |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | $0                                         | 0%          | 10%             | 1%              |
| 2     | $1,500                                     | 5%          | 15%             | 2%              |
| 3     | $3,000                                     | 5%          | 20%             | 4%              |
| 4     | $6,000                                     | 5%          | 25%             | 6%              |
| 5     | $12,000                                    | 5%          | 30%             | 8%              |
| 6     | $24,000                                    | 5%          | 35%             | 10%             |
