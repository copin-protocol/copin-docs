# Vault Copy Trading

#### **What is Vault Copy Trading?**

Vault Copy Trading is a powerful feature on Copin that allows you to automatically copy trading strategies from expert on-chain traders, without needing to execute trades manually. Managed by Copin's dedicated **Data Analytics (DA) team**, this feature enables users to deposit their USDC (Arbitrum) and have their funds allocated to carefully selected traders. These trades are then executed automatically through smart contracts, ensuring transparency, security, and efficiency.

By using Vault Copy Trading, users can benefit from advanced strategies while minimizing the complexity of active trading.

#### **How Vault Copy Trading Works**

1. **Deposit USDC**\
   After connecting your **MetaMask** wallet to Copin, you can deposit **USDC (Arbitrum)** directly into the Vault. The minimum deposit required is **100 USDC,** maximum deposit is **100,000 USDC**&#x20;
2. **Copy Trades Automatically**\
   Once your funds are in the Vault, our **Data Analytics team** will manage the trading by selecting top-performing on-chain pro traders. Your funds will then automatically mirror the strategies and trades of these experts.
3. **Smart Contracts & Transparency**\
   All trading decisions are executed automatically through smart contracts, ensuring that you have a fully transparent view of all transactions. You can track these transactions directly on the blockchain for peace of mind.
