## 2. Fee Structure for Copy Trading on gTrade &#x20;

In the trading industry, fees are typically calculated based on the total trading size of a position (collateral x leverage). On Copin.io, there are three types of fees that users need to be aware of:

1. **Copin Fees**
2. **Execution Fees**
3. **PerpDEX/Liquidity Fees**

These fees cover the costs associated with using the Copin platform, executing copy trades, and utilizing the underlying PerpDEX platform (e.g., gTrade).
