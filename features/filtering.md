* \[2] - The filtered results provide an estimated count of traders that meet the specified criteria.
* \[3] - You can easily add, edit, and delete trader filter conditions as per your requirements.

## Filter by time-range

Filtering by Time Range: This enables you to narrow down traders' activity based on specific time periods, such as the last 7 days, last 14 days, last 30 days, last 60 days, or customized time frames. Additionally, Copin offers a user-friendly time filter feature directly on the candlestick chart, providing convenience and usefulness in analyzing data over different time intervals.

## Sort by parameter

The sort-by-parameter functionality enables you to arrange the ranking of traders either in descending order (high to low) or ascending order (low to high) based on the selected criteria fields.
