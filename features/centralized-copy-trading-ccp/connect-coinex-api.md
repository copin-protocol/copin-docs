## 2. Identity Verification

KYC stands for Know Your Customer, which refers to verifying or assessing a customer’s identity. KYC aims to promote Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts and protect against financial fraud and identity theft.

## 3. 2FA Security

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security method that requires you to enter a verification code generated on your mobile device to perform actions such as logging in and transferring funds. Linking your account with Google Authenticator can enhance security and reduce potential risks to your account.
