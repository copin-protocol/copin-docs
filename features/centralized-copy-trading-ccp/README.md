# Copy Trading

At Copin, the Copy Trading feature elegantly addresses the diverse needs within Perp DEXs, offering a dual advantage. It serves as an educational platform for new users, guiding them through a controlled and risk-managed trading environment, while also providing advanced traders with sophisticated tools to enhance their trading strategies. This balanced approach ensures that Copin is an invaluable resource for traders at any level of expertise.

## **How to start Copy Trading?**

The process of copy trading involves choosing an experienced trader to follow and then mirroring their trading activities in your own portfolio. Here’s how it works:

### **Step 1: Selecting a Trader**

In the first step of Copin's Copytrading, selecting a trader is streamlined through [Trader Explorer](https://app.copin.io/), [Leaderboard](https://app.copin.io/leaderboard), or by a known trader's wallet address.

Ensure their performance and strategies align with your investment goals with Copin's integrated assessment tools.

Once you find the right match, you can begin copying their trades with a simple click on the 'Copy Trader' button.
