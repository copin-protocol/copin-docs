In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEX) offering perpetual derivative products has reached impressive figures. Currently, there are over 50 active perpetual DEX across various blockchains and Layer2 networks, hosting more than 2 million traders and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $330 billion. Given the immense scale and complexity of the perpetual DEX landscape in DeFi, the need for a comprehensive and efficient tool becomes paramount.&#x20;

This necessity arises from the difficulty in accessing, analyzing, and effectively utilizing the extensive data available. Traders not only seek a reliable source for this data but also require a platform that allows them to review their trading history, assess profit performance, and benchmark their strategies against others. To address these intricate challenges and to offer a seamless solution that caters to these specific needs in the DeFi space.

**Copin has been created!**

## What is Copin.io?

[Copin.io](https://copin.io) is a platform designed for the mass adoption of the perpetual DEX narrative. It enables users to explore, analyze, and copy on-chain traders from the top of Perpetual DEX exchanges like dYdx, GMX, Kwenta, etc.

Our focus is on leveraging on-chain data from Decentralized Perpetual Exchanges to mitigate market fragmentation. We aim to utilize this data for diverse applications like copy trading, social trading platforms or advanced trader data analysis tools.

### Our data framework

Copin.io is focusing extensively on public blockchain data from decentralized exchanges, specifically perpetual decentralized exchanges (DEXs) enriching the on-chain perpetual landscape transparently and reliably. Here's a breakdown of how Copin operates:

#### **Extract & Load**

First, raw on-chain trading data from perpetual DEXs such as GMX, Kwenta, PolynomialFi, dYdX, and others is extracted and loaded into a dedicated data warehouse.

#### **Data Transformation**

This raw data is then converted and cleansed, undergoing a transformation into formats that are easily understandable and accessible. The result is a dataset enriched with over 2 million trader profiles and billions of position trades from perpetual DEXs.

#### **Creating Use Cases**

Finally, this rich dataset serves as the foundation for Copin's API, which, in turn, enables the offering of a variety of valuable features to provide a multitude of use cases, ensuring that the features are both diverse and tailored to user needs. A best-in-class, multi-chain perpetual decentralized exchange data warehouse is managed, enabling you and your organization to concentrate on research, analysis, and product development, while alleviating the burden of resource-intensive data engineering.

## Our mission

The mission of Copin.io is to drive the widespread acceptance and understanding of the perpetual Decentralized Exchange (perp DEX) narrative, positioning ourselves as a catalyst for the next bull run in the financial market. We believe that by illuminating the intricacies and potential of perp DEXes, we can lead a transformative shift in the decentralized finance landscape.
