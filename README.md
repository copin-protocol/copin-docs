### **Some things you can do with Copin**

1. **Analyze On-Chain Trader Data**&#x20;

Copin provides comprehensive on-chain trader data gathered from blockchain networks and decentralized exchanges. Users can analyze this data to gain insights into the performance, positions, and trading strategies of on-chain traders.

* Evaluate Trader Rankings: Copin displays a ranking of on-chain traders based on different criteria such as ROI, PnL, win-rate, and more. Users can assess the rankings to identify successful traders and evaluate their past performance.
* Backtesting: Enables users to assess the historical performance of traders or trading strategies before choosing to copy them. These features offer valuable insights into past performance, aiding users in evaluating potential future success.

2. **Copy Trading**&#x20;

Copin enables users to copy the trading signals of elite on-chain traders. Users can align their trades with those of successful traders, potentially benefiting from their expertise and achieving similar returns.

* **Customize Copy Settings:** Copin allows users to customize their copy trading settings, including trade size, risk management parameters, and asset allocation. This customization empowers users to tailor their copy trading experience according to their individual preferences, risk tolerance, and investment goals.
* **Monitor and Track Performance:** Users can monitor and track the performance of the traders they have chosen to copy. Copin provides transparency in the trading activities and historical performance of these traders, allowing users to assess the success and risk profile of their copied trades.
* **Risk management solutions:** Through the volume protection mechanism, Copin applies an averaging method using the trader's volume within a specified range of previous orders as a protective measure. If the trader's volume is significantly smaller than the average volume of the specified range, the copier account will copy a percentage of the initially set volume. This mechanism aims to maintain a balanced approach and manage risk for copiers.
