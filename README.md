In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEX) offering perpetual derivative products has reached impressive figures. Currently, there are over 50 active perpetual DEX across various blockchains and Layer2 networks, hosting more than 2 million traders and facilitating a trading volume exceeding $330 billion. However, accessing, analyzing, and evaluating this vast data remains a significant challenge. Traders also require a platform to review their trading history, assess profit performance, and compare with others to enhance their trading strategies.

Enter Copin, a solution addressing this challenge. It's an advanced platform that aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes data from all perpetual DEX on blockchains. Copin not only provides access to comprehensive and detailed data but also assists users in deeply understanding and leveraging this information for smarter investment decisions. Our platform delivers value not just to individual traders but also to organizations, analysts, and anyone interested in derivative trading markets.

Copin's goal is to offer transparency, efficiency, and profound market insights into the DeFi perpetual derivative market while enhancing users' assessment and risk management abilities. With Copin, big data ceases to be a barrier; instead, it becomes a valuable resource, unlocking new avenues for the growth of decentralized finance.
