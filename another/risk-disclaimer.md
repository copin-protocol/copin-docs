## RISK WARNING&#x20;

Trading crypto involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Prior to using Copin, it is essential to carefully consider your investment objectives, financial situation, needs, and level of experience. Copin offers general advice and does not take into account your specific objectives, financial situation, or needs. The content on this website should not be considered as personal advice. There is a possibility of sustaining a loss that exceeds your deposited funds, so it is important not to speculate with capital you cannot afford to lose. You should be fully aware of all the risks associated with trading on margin. Please seek professional advice if needed before engaging in any trading activities on the Copin platform.

## TRADING RISKS&#x20;

Utilizing an internet-based deal-execution trading system, including Copin, comes with inherent risks. These risks encompass potential failures in hardware, software, and internet connectivity. As Copin does not have control over signal power, its internet reception, or routing, and cannot influence the configuration or reliability of users' equipment or connections, we cannot be held responsible for communication failures, distortions, or delays when trading via the internet. Traders should be aware of these risks and consider them when making investment decisions on the Copin platform.

## COPY TRADE PLATFORM&#x20;

The Copy Trading Service on Copin allows users to follow a selected trader's activities, copy their trading strategies, and access their performance history, rankings, risk profile, and other relevant information. It's important to understand that subscribing to the Copy Trading Service means taking full responsibility for your investment decisions and conducting your own research to determine if a trade or strategy aligns with your objectives and financial situation. Copin does not provide financial advice, and using the Copy Trading Service should not be considered as such.

By subscribing to the Copy Trading Service, you acknowledge and comprehend the risks associated with copying a trader's account and their trading objectives. You alone are responsible for relying on advice or information from third-party providers. It's essential to recognize that copy trading involves inherent risks, and you could experience significant losses. When using the Copy Trading Service, you do so at your own risk, and Copin will not be held liable for any losses that may occur as a result of your participation in the service.

By clicking "I agree," you provide authorization to the Platform to execute all trades and positions initiated by the trader, account, portfolio, or strategy that you choose to follow and copy through the Copy Trading Service. Once you initiate a trade, the automated trading execution takes over, opening and closing trades in your account without requiring any manual intervention from you. It's important to note that all activities related to the Copy Trading Service are subject to the provisions outlined in the Terms of Services, which govern the usage and functionality of the service.

In our Terms of Service, we want to make it clear that we do not guarantee the filling of any orders you place. It's essential to understand that orders may be subject to delays or other conditions that are beyond our control, such as system processing delays, mechanical or electronic failures, or market conditions related to liquidity and volatility. As a result, we cannot be held responsible for ensuring the execution of orders at the exact price indicated in your order, should any delays or other conditions impact transmission or execution. It's important for users to be aware of these risks and factors when using our platform for trading activities.

Copin wants to emphasize that we do not provide any guarantees for the copy trade system offered by third-party platform providers. Therefore, using these third-party platform providers is entirely at the investor's own risk. It is essential to acknowledge and agree that Copin is not responsible for any deficiencies, trading system errors, misrepresentations, or any misconduct on the part of these third-party platform providers.

Furthermore, Copin will not be held responsible for refunding lost profits resulting from platform errors, regardless of the circumstances. Neither Copin, nor our officers, principals, employees, or agents shall be liable to any person for any losses, damages, costs, or expenses (including, but not limited to, loss of profits, loss of use, direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages) arising from any errors in the Copy Trade Platform. Users should be aware of these factors and take personal responsibility for using the platform and engaging with third-party providers accordingly.
