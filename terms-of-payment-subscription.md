# Terms of Payment Subscription

1\. **Subscription Model**

Copin operates on a subscription-based access model. By subscribing to any of our paid plans, you gain access to premium features for a specified period (monthly or annually, depending on your choice).

#### 2. **Manual Payment Required**

* **Copin does not support automatic recurring payments.**
* At the end of each subscription period, your plan will **not** renew automatically.
* If you wish to continue using the paid services, you must manually renew your subscription through your account dashboard.

#### 3. **No Refund Policy**

* **All payments made to Copin are non-refundable.**
* This includes cases such as unused subscription time, accidental purchases, or dissatisfaction with the service.
* Please ensure you review the plan and features carefully before completing payment.

#### 4. **Subscription Expiry**

* If you do not renew your subscription after it expires, your account will be downgraded to the free plan automatically.
* You will retain access to your data, but premium features will no longer be available until payment is made again.

#### 5. **Changes to Subscription Terms**

* Copin reserves the right to modify subscription pricing, features, or terms. Users will be notified in advance of any significant changes.
